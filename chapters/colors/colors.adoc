== Different kinds of color image

One way to introduce color into images is to use a suitable LUT, as
described in <<../images_and_pixels/images_and_pixels.adoc#chap, Images & pixels>>. However, then the fact
that different colors could be involved in the display of such images
was really only incidental: at each location in the image there was
still only one channel, one pixel and one value.

For images in which color is more intrinsic – that is, when the channel
number is an extra dimension (see <<../dimensions/dimensions.adoc#chap, Dimensions>>) and we want to
display channels superimposed on top of one another – things become more
complex, because the precise color in the display for one location now
depends upon a combination of multiple pixel values mixed together.

There are two main types of color image we will consider in this
chapter, and it is important to know the difference between them:

1.  _Multichannel / composite images_ – good for analysis, since they
can contain the original pixels given by the microscope, but may appear
differently (or not be readable at all) in some software
2.  _RGB images_ – good for display, because they have a consistent
appearance, but often unsuitable for quantitative analysis because
original pixel values are likely to be lost

[[multichannel-images]]
Multichannel images
-------------------

We consider a 'true' multichannel image here to be one in which the
channel number is an extra dimension. Pixel values for each channel are
often determined from light that has been filtered according to its
wavelength. In principle, any LUT might be applied to each channel, but
it makes sense to choose LUTs that somehow relate to the wavelength
(i.e. color) of light detected for the corresponding channels. Channels
can then be overlaid on top of one another, and their colors further
merged for display (e.g. high values in green and red channels are shown
as yellow).

The important feature of these images is that the actual channel
information is always retained, and so the original pixel values remain
available. This means you can still extract channels or adjust their
LUTs as needed.

In ImageJ, such representations of multiple channels are sometimes known
as _composite images_. An example can be opened by selecting
menu:File[Open Samples > Fluorescent Cells (400K)]
(Figure <<fig-fiji_composite>>). As you move the slider at the bottom of
the image, it might not look like much is happening. But if you also
open the `Brightness/Contrast...` tool you can see that the color of the
histogram changes for each slider position. Adjusting the contrast then
adjusts it _only for the current channel_. This is very useful because
quite different contrast settings can be required for each channel to
get a decent final appearance. Also, as you move the mouse over the
image the 'value' shown in the status bar is the pixel value _only for
that channel_.

Composite images allow us to see multiple channels at the same time. But
sometimes this masks information and it helps to look at each channel
individually. One way to do this is to choose
menu:Image[Color > Split Channels], which will give you separate images for
each channel. But a more powerful option is to select
menu:Image[Color > Channels Tool...].

Using the `Fluorescent Cells (400K)` image, explore the use of the
`Channels Tool...` until you are comfortable with what it does, including
what happens when you click on the colors under `More>>`.

How do composite images relate to the LUTs we described before? Try out
some of the commands in menu:Image[Lookup Tables > ] when investigating this.

Each individual channel in a composite image is really just being shown
with a LUT – most often one that is predominantly red, green or blue.
The final displayed color results from mixing the channel colors
together. Therefore, in principle any LUT might be used for each
channel. But unconventional LUT choices can easily result in rather
avant garde images that are difficult to interpret.

[[rgb-images]]
RGB images
----------

Composite images can contain any number of channels, and these channels
can have any of the bit-depths ImageJ supports (see
<<../bit_depths/bit_depths.adoc#chap, Types & bit-depths>>) – so long as all channels have the same
bit-depth. By contrast, RGB images invariably have 3 channels, and each
channel is 8-bitfootnote:[This is the case in ImageJ, and usually (but
not always) in other software. For example, it is possible for an RGB
image to be 16-bit, and some contain an extra 'alpha' channel (which
relates to transparency), and so might be called ARGB or RGBA. But such
images do not often occur in science.]. Furthermore, the channel colors
in an RGB image are fixed to __r__ed, __g__reen and __b__lue.

This already makes clear that composite images can (at least
potentially) contain much more information. However, the inflexibility
of RGB images has one important advantage: compatibility. Computer
monitors generate colors for display by mixing red, green and blue
light.  RGB images can dictate directly how much of each color
should be used.  This means that the values in each RGB channel really do determine the final
image appearance, without any ambiguity regarding which LUTs should be
applied because these are already known. Therefore all software can
display RGB images in the same way.

[[rgb-images-in-imagej]]
RGB images in ImageJ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RGB images can be easily distinguished from composite images in ImageJ
both because they do not have an additional slider at the bottom to move
between channels, and because the text `RGB` appears at the top of the
image window in place of the bit-depth. Also, moving the cursor over an
RGB image leads to 3 numbers following the `value` label in the main
status bar: the pixel values for each of the channels.

Changing the brightness/contrast of an RGB image is also different.
Making adjustments using the normal `Brightness/Contrast...` tool leads to
the appearance of all 3 channels being affected simultaneously.

[[comparison-of-color-images]]
Comparison of color images
---------------------------

Only composite images can therefore store more than three channels, or
data with a bit-depth higher than 8. Consequently, if acquisition
software provides the option to save data in an RGB format, this
temptation should normally be resisted – unless you _also_ save the
image in the software manufacturer's preferred, non-RGB format, and only
use this latter version for analysisfootnote:[This assumes fluorescence microscopy data. For an application when RGB is often suitable, see <<../files/files.adoc#sec-whole_slide_images, Whole slide images>>.].
The reason is that the conversion
of a composite image to RGB _can_ result in a significant loss of
information, and if we only have the RGB version it may be impossible
for us to say whether or not this loss has occurred.

You can test the compatibility of composite and RGB images by opening
menu:File[Open Samples > HeLa Cells] image, and saving it using
menu:File[Save As > Tiff...] both before and after running
menu:Image[Type > RGB Color] to convert the original 16-bit composite data
to RGB. Try then opening both saved images in other software (e.g.
Microsoft PowerPoint) and compare their appearance.

Think of at least 2 ways in which converting a composite image to RGB
can lose information.

You can explore this by comparing the images `Cell_composite.tif` and
`Cell_RGB.tif`. The menu:Image[Color > Split Channels] command should help.

.Answer

One way that converting an image to RGB can lose information is if the
original data is 16-bit before conversion and 8-bit afterwards, causing
rounding and/or clipping to occur (see <<../bit_depths/bit_depths.adoc#chap, Types & bit-depths>>).

Another is that during conversion the channels have been forced to be
purely red, green and blue. But perhaps they were not originally so, and
separate channels have been merged into the same ones. If you had
started with more than three channels, this will definitely have
occurred, but even if you had fewer channels you can have problems (like
in the `Cell_composite.tif` and `Cell_RGB.tif` examples).

The trouble with _only_ having an RGB image is that it is no longer
possible to know for sure what the original data looked like, to be able
to figure out whether anything has been lost. For example, perhaps you
have managed to generate a magnificent image consisting of turquoise,
yellow and dazzling pink channels. Each pixel is displayed on screen as
a combination of those colors. However, precisely the same color for
any pixel can also be represented – rather more simply – as a mixture of
red, green and blue. So no matter what channels and colors you began
with, the final result after merging can be replicated using red, green
and blue channels. But if you _only_ have the RGB version, you might
never be able to extract the original 3 channels again. Their colors
could be so mixed together that the original pixel values would be
irretrievably lost.

And so the good things about RGB images is that they look identical to
the original image you had before conversion, and other software (e.g.
webbrowsers or PowerPoint) can understand them effortlessly. But the
_potentially very bad_ thing about RGB images is that creating them
requires conversion, and after this it might very well be _impossible_
to regain the original pixel values.
--

Still, there is no way of _displaying_ a composite image that cannot be
replicated by an RGB image, because the monitor itself works with RGB
data (translated to red, green and blue light). Therefore for creating
figures or presentations, converting data to RGB is a very _good_ idea
for the compatibility advantages it brings. In the end, it is normal to
need to keep at least two versions of each dataset: one in the original
(multichannel / composite) format, and one as RGB for display. This RGB
image is normally created as the _final_ step, after applying any
processing or LUT adjustments to the original data.

[[other-color-spaces]]
Other color spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since monitors work with RGB images, in practice what you are actually
seeing on screen is always an RGB image – even when we are actually
working with the data in a composite image. The RGB version is just
quietly made in the background based on the composite data so that the
monitor can give us something to look at. If we convert the composite
image to RGB we then basically just throw away all the extra useful
information the composite contained, and keep only the displayed
version.

However, there are more ways to represent colors than just mixtures of
red, green and blue light. One familiar example is using cyan, magenta,
yellow and black ink – leading to a CMYK representation of color. In
practice, fewer colors can be faithfully reproduced using CMYK when
compared to RGB, which is one reason why printed images often do not
seem to have quite the same colors as the same images on screen.

The other main color representation that turns up in ImageJ is HSB,
which stands for _Hue_, _Saturation_ and _Brightness_. An RGB image can
be converted to HSB using menu:Image[Type > HSB Stack]. In practice, this
representation can be useful for detecting features in color images
that were originally RGB (e.g. conventional photographs, or some brightfield images), but it is
largely irrelevant for fluorescence microscopy.

.Choosing channel colors
[.info]

image:images/fluorescent_cells_orig_crop.jpg[180,180,float="right"]

By changing the LUTs, channels can be assigned any color you like.
Although red/green images are widespread, especially for colocalization,
they are particularly unhelpful for colorblind people. More accessible
images can be created by switching the LUTs of at least one channel to
something more suitable (e.g. Red &rarr; Magenta) – although displaying both
channels separately is better still.

image:images/fluorescent_cells_cb_crop.jpg[180,180,float="right"]

You can also test the effects of different colors using the Fiji
command menu:Image[Color > Simulate Color Blindness] (note that this may
require converting the image to RGB first).

.Question
[.question]
****
ImageJ has two different copying commands, menu:Edit[Copy] and
menu:Edit[Copy to System]. Why?

_Note:_ When investigating this, you should explore menu:Edit[Paste],
alongside two commands in the menu:File[New > ] submenu. Be on the lookout
for any conversions.

.Answer
[.solution]
--
menu:Edit[Copy] and menu:Edit[Copy to System] have quite distinct purposes. The former
allows you to copy part of an individual image slice (i.e. a 2D part of
a particular color channel) and paste it into another image while
exactly preserving the original image type and pixel values. However,
this image type might well not be compatible with other software,
therefore images copied in this way cannot be accessed outside ImageJ.
If you want to copy an image and paste it into other software, you need
menu:Edit[Copy to System]. This copies the image to the system clipboard,
converting it to RGB in the process, thereby preserving appearance – but
not necessarily the pixel values.
