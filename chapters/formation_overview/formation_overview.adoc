The big picture of fluorescence imaging
---------------------------------------

Images in fluorescence microscopy are formed by detecting light – and
such small amounts of light that it can be thought of in terms of
individual photons. The photons are emitted from fluorescent molecules
within the sample being imaged. Sometimes these photon-emitting
molecules may be the very things we are interested in studying, but
often they have only been introduced to the sample because they have the
helpful property of fluorescing when in the presence of the (otherwise
non-fluorescent) molecules or structures we would _really_ like to see.

Either way, the most that the image can tell us is how much light was
emitted from any particular point. From this information we make our
interpretations, such as about the presence of absence of some feature,
about the size and shape of a structure, or about the relative
concentration of a molecule. But in no case are we seeing the feature,
structure or molecule directly in the recorded images: we only have
measurements of numbers of photons we could detect.

We will not give much attention here to what any particular number of
photons emanating from a sample really indicates from a biological point
of view – this would depend too much upon the design and details of the
experiment, i.e. on the cells, stains and other substances involved. We
can, however, often make general assumptions, such as that if we were to
see (on average) twice as many photons originating from one region as
from another, the number of fluorescing molecules must be around twice
as high in the first regionfootnote:[This assumes a linear relationship,
which does not always hold (e.g. if there is dye saturation, or high
laser powers are used for illumination).]. But before we can worry about
such things, we first need to concentrate upon how accurately we can
even determine the number and origins of photons being emitted from the
sample, given the limited quality of the images we can actually record.

Once a specimen has been prepared and is waiting underneath the
microscope, the basic process of recording a fluorescence image
comprises four main steps (summarized in Figure <<fig-intro_recording>>):

1.  _Fluorophore excitation._ The fluorescent molecules (fluorophores)
first need to be raised into an excited state. This happens upon the
absorption of a photon, the energy (i.e. wavelength) of which should
fall into a range specific to the fluorophore itself. This is carried
out by illuminating the specimen, e.g. with a lamp or laser.
2.  _Photon emission._ When returning to its ground state, each
fluorophore may emit a photon – this time with a lower energy (i.e.
longer wavelength) than the photon previously absorbed.
3.  _Photon detection._ Most emitted photons can be thought of, rather
informally, as 'shooting off in the wrong direction', in which case we
have no hope of detecting them. But a proportion of the light should
enter the objective lens of the microscope and be focussed towards a
detector. When a photon strikes the detector, it is registered as a
'hit' by the release of an electron (when we are lucky; detectors are
imperfect so this might not occur, meaning the photon is effectively
lost).
4.  _Quantification & storage._ After fixed time intervals, the charges
of the electrons produced by photons striking the detector are
quantified, and from these quantifications pixel values are determined.
A larger charge indicates more photons, which translates into a higher
pixel value.


[[errors-and-imprecisions]]
Errors and imprecisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the above summary, it is clear that we are quite some distance away
from knowing exactly how much light is emitted from the specimen: most
photons do not reach the detector, and many that do are still not
registered. But since we can expect to always lose track of a similar
proportion of emitted light – perhaps 90% – this does not matter much:
we can expect all parts of the image to be similarly affected, so
relative differences in brightness would still be reflected in our pixel
values. However, there are two more critical ways in which the images we
can record are less good than the images we would like:

1.  _Uncertainty in space._ Ideally, all light originating from a
particular point in the specimen would strike the detector in exactly
the same place, and therefore end up contributing to exactly the same
pixel. In practice, however, _the light beginning from one point cannot
be focused back to a single point on the detector_. Consequently, it can
end up being spread over several pixels. The end result is that the
image is _blurred_.
2.  _Uncertainty in brightness._ When an image is blurry we would also
expect it to be smooth, but this is not usually what we get in
fluorescence microscopy. Rather, there are seemingly random variations
in brightness everywhere throughout the image: the _noise_. Some noise
can come from imprecisions when determining the charge of small clouds
of electrons quickly. But, more curiously, _the emission of the photons
is itself random_, so that even if we detected every photon perfectly we
would still get noisy images.

These issues are depicted in Figure <<fig-colored_spots>>.

The difference between what we might wish to image, and what we actually can image.
In both cases (A and B), the 'real' scene is shown on the left.
Ideally, the small colored spots in reality would directly map to colored spots of a related size and separation in the image (A).
However, the light emitted from these spots would actually end up producing larger objects in the image, which can then blur together (B, center).
Noise is further added to this blurriness to give us the best image we can really record (B, right).
--

The twin issues of blur and noise do not affect all images equally. For
example, blur can cause us to misjudge the size of something by several
hundred nanometers, but if the thing we are measuring is much larger
than this then the error may be trivial. Also, if we are detecting many
thousands of photons then the uncertainty due to noise may be extremely
small relative to the numbers involved. But very often we are interested
in measuring tiny structures in images containing only tens of photons
at their brightest points. In these cases, the effects of blur and noise
cannot be ignored.
