The goal of analysis
--------------------

Successfully extracting useful information from fluorescence images
usually requires triumphing in two main battles. The first is to
overcome limitations in image quality and make the really interesting
image content more clearly visible. This involves _image processing_,
the output of which is another image. The second battle is to compute
meaningful measurements. This is _image analysis_. Except when creating
beautiful figures, the ultimate goal we are most interested in here is
analysis – but processing is almost always indispensable to get us
there.

One way to approach image analysis is to see it like a puzzle. In the
end, one hopes to extract some kind of quantitative measurements that
are justified by the nature of the experiment and the facts of image
formation, but there is no fixed way to go about that. This liberating
realization suggests there is room for lateral thinking and sparks of
creativity. Admittedly, if no solution comes to mind after pondering for
a while then such an optimistic outlook quickly subsides and the
'puzzle' may very well turn into an unbearably infuriating 'problem' –
but the point here is that _in principle_ image analysis _can_ be
enjoyable. All it takes is properly-acquired data, a modicum of
enthusiasm, and the good luck not to be working on something
horrendously difficult.

Despite the diversity of algorithmsfootnote:[An 'algorithm' can be
considered to be simply a 'sequence of steps'.] that could be
constructed to analyze an image, in practice they generally tend to be
built up from the following three stages:

1.  _(Pre)processing_, e.g. subtract the background, use a filter to
reduce noise
2.  _Detection_, e.g. apply a threshold to locate interesting features,
refine the detection
3.  _Measurement_, e.g. count pixels to determine areas or volumes,
quantify intensities

Figure <<fig-workflow>> shows an example of how these can fit together.

Part II of this handbook provides a tour of many of the fundamental techniques that may
be used for each of the three stages. Armed with only these techniques,
a vast amount is already achievable: the challenge is to figure out how
to string them together for whatever application you encounter. But even
if you ultimately end up doing your analysis with someone else's
automated software or plugin, knowing the main building blocks of image
processing and analysis can still help explain what the algorithm you
use is really doing and why.

The following chapters deal primarily with 2D images.
<<../multidimensional_processing/multidimensional_processing.adoc#chap, Processing data with higher dimensions>> then briefly discusses how
the techniques can be extended into more dimensions, before
<<../macro_intro/macro_intro.adoc#chap, Writing macros>> provides an introduction to creating macros that
can be used to automate all or part of an analysis workflow.
