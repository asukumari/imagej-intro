[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

Successfully analyzing an image requires that it actually contains the
necessary information in the first place. There are various practical
issues related to the biology (e.g. not interfering too much with
processes, such as by inadvertently killing things) and data handling
(bit-depths, file formats, anything else in Part I of this handbook).
However, assuming that these are in order, there are three other main
factors to consider connected to the image contents:

1.  _Spatial information_, dependent on the size and shape of the PSF,
2.  _Noise_, dependent on the number of photons detected,
3.  _Temporal resolution_, dependent on the speed at which the
microscope can record images.

No one type of microscope is currently able to optimize all of these
simultaneously, and so decisions and compromises need to be made.
Temporal resolution and noise have an obvious relationship, in that a
high temporal resolution means that less time is spent detecting photons
in the image, leading to more photon noise. However, improving spatial
information is also often related to one or both of the other two
factors.

This chapter gives a very brief overview of the main features of several
fluorescence microscopes from the point of view of how they balance the
tradeoffs mentioned. **Be aware that it does _not_ do justice to all the
complexities, variations and features of the microscopes it describes,
and it is not written by an expert in microscopy - and therefore should be treated with some caution!**

But it is included nonetheless in case it might be useful to anyone as a starting pointfootnote:[For a more extensive, and authoritative, description of the topics considered here, consider seeking out the _Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy_ edited by James Pawley.  This contains many excellent chapters, some of which may be freely available to download from the publisher's website.].

Schematic diagrams to show the differences in
excitation patterns. Here, an inverted microscope is assumed (the cell
is resting on a coverslip, and illuminated from below). During the
recording of a pixel, light can potentially be detected if it arises
from any part of the green-illuminated region, although in the laser
scanning and spinning disk confocal cases the pinhole will only permit a
fraction of this light to pass through. Note that, for the 2-photon
microscope, the excitation is confined to only the small, central
region, while the red light above and below is not capable of exciting
the fluorophores that have been used.
--

[[widefield]]
Widefield
~~~~~~~~~

So far, our <<../formation_overview/formation_overview.adoc#fig-intro_recording, schematic diagrams>> and
PSF discussion (see <<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#chap, Blur & the PSF>>) have concentrated on
_widefield microscopes_. In widefield microscopy, the entire sample is
bathed in light, so that many fluorophores throughout the sample can be
excited and emit photons simultaneously. All of the light that enters
the objective may then be detected and contribute to any image being
recorded. Because photons are potentially emitted from everywhere in the
sample, there will be a lot of blur present for a thick specimen (for a
thin specimen there is not much light from out-of-focus planes because
the planes simply do not contain anything that can fluoresce). What we
get in any single recorded image is effectively the sum of the light
from the in-focus plane, and every other out-of-focus plane. Viewed in
terms of PSFs, we capture <<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#fig-psf_planes, part of the hourglass shape produced by every
light-emitting point depending upon how in-focus it is in every image>>.

This is bad news for spatial information and also for detecting small
structures in thick samples, as the <<../formation_noise/formation_noise.adoc#fig-poisson_ramp, out-of-focus light is essentially
background>>. On the other
hand, widefield images tend to include a lot of photons, which overcomes
read noise, even when they are recorded fast.

[[laser-scanning-confocal]]
Laser scanning confocal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Optical sectioning_ is the ability to detect photons only from the
plane of focus, rejecting those from elsewhere. This is necessary to
look into thick samples without getting lost in the haze of other
planes. _Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM)_ achieves this by
only concentrating on detecting light for one pixel at any time, and
using a pinhole to try to only allow light from a corresponding point in
the sample to be detected.

Because at most only one pixel is being recorded at any given moment, it
does not make sense to illuminate the entire sample at once, which could
do unnecessary damage. Rather, a laser illuminates only a small volume.
If this would be made small enough, then a pinhole would not actually be
needed because we would know that all emitted light _must_ be coming
from the illuminated spot; however, the illumination itself is like an
hour-glass PSF in the specimen and so the pinhole is necessary to make
sure only the light from the central part is detected. This then causes
the final PSF, as it appears _in the image_, to take on more of a
rugby-ball (or American football) appearance.

The end result is an image that has relatively little out-of-focus
light. This causes a significant improvement in what can be seen along
the __z__-dimension, although the __xy__ resolution
is not very different to the widefield case. Also, because single pixels
are recorded separately, the image can (potentially) be more or less any
size and shape – rather than limited by the <<sec-ccds, pixel count on a camera>>.

However, these advantages comes with a major drawback. Images usually
contain thousands to millions of pixels, and so only a tiny fraction of
the time required to record an image is spent detecting photons for any
one pixel in a LSCM image – unlike in the widefield case, where photons
can be detected for all pixels over the entire image acquisition time.
This can cause LSCM image acquisition to be comparatively slow, noisy
(in terms of few detected photons) or both. Spatial information is
therefore gained at a cost in noise and/or temporal resolution.


.Question
[.question]
****
Why is it often recommended that the pinhole in LSCM be set to
have the same size as one Airy disk? And why is it sometimes better not
to strictly follow this recommendation?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
As described in <<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#sec-intro_blur_airy, Blur & the PSF>>, the vast
majority (approximately 80%) of the light from the in-focus plane falls
within the Airy disk. Using a
pinhole smaller than this can result in so little light being detected
that the image becomes too noisy to be useful. On the other hand,
increasing the size of the pinhole will result in some more of the
remaining 20% located in the outer rings of the Airy pattern, but _most_
extra photons will come from out-of-focus planes. This causes a
reduction in the effectiveness of the optical sectioning. Therefore, a
pinhole diameter of approximately 1 Airy disk provides a reasonable
balance between detecting most of the in-focus light and achieving good
optical sectioning.

Nevertheless, sometimes a reduction in optical sectioning is a
worthwhile cost – such as when photons are very scarce, and some extra
background is tolerable. Also, when recording a multichannel image then
you may well have to set the pinhole size according to the Airy disk for
one channel. But because the size of the disk depends upon the light
wavelength (as described in <<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#eqn-res_lateral, Blur & the PSF>>), the pinhole diameter will
differ in terms of Airy disk sizes for other channels.

[[spinning-disk-confocal]]
Spinning disk confocal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So a widefield system records all pixels at once without blocking the
light from reaching the detector anywhere, whereas a LSCM can block
out-of-focus light by only recording a single pixel at a time. Both
options sound extreme: could there not be a compromise?

_Spinning disk confocal microscopy_ (SDCM) implements one such
compromise by using a large number of pinholes punched into a disk, so
that the fluorophores can be excited and light detected for many
different _non-adjacent_ pixels simultaneously. By not trying to record
adjacent pixels at the same time, pinholes can be used to block _most_
of the out-of-focus light for each pixel, since this originates close to
the region of interest for that pixel (i.e. the PSF becomes very dim at
locations far away from its center) – but sufficiently-spaced pixels can
still be recorded simultaneously with little influence on one another.

In practice, spinning disk confocal microscopy images are likely to be
less sharp than laser scanning confocal images because some light does
scatter through other pinholes. Also, the pinhole sizes cannot be
adjusted to fine-tune the balance between noise and optical sectioning.
However, the optical sectioning offered by SDCM is at least a
considerable improvement over the widefield case, and an acceptable SNR
can be achieved with much faster frame-rates using SDCM as opposed to
LSCM.

[[multiphoton-microscopy]]
Multiphoton microscopy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As previously mentioned, if the size of excitation volume could be
reduced enough, then we would know where the photons originated even
without a pinhole being required – but focused excitation is generally
still subject to PSF-related issues, so that fluorophores throughout a
whole hourglass-shaped volume can end up being excited. The main idea of
multiphoton microscopy is that fluorophore excitation requires the
_simultaneous absorption of multiple photons_, rather than only a single
photon. The excitation light has a longer wavelength than would
otherwise be required to cause molecular excitation with a single
photon, but the energies of the multiple photons combine to cause the
excitation.

The benefit of this is that the multiphoton excitation only occurs at
the focal region of the excitation – elsewhere within the 'specimen PSF'
the light intensities are insufficient to produce the 'multiphoton
effect' and raise the fluorophores into an excited state. This means
that the region of the specimen emitting photons at any one time is much
smaller than when using single photon excitation (as in LSCM), and also
less damage is being caused to the sample. Furthermore, multiphoton
microscopy is able to penetrate deeper into a specimen – up to several
hundred µm.

[[total-internal-reflection-fluorescence]]
Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As previously mentioned, widefield images of very thin specimens do not
suffer much from out-of-focus blur because light is not emitted from
many other planes. _Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence_ (TIRF)
microscopy makes use of this by stimulating fluorescence only in a very
thin section of the sample close to the objective. Very briefly, TIRF
microscopy involves using an illumination angled so that the change in
refractive index encountered by the light as it approaches the specimen
causes a further change in angle sufficient to prevent the light from
directly entering the specimen (i.e. it is 'totally internally
reflected'). Nevertheless, fluorophores can still be excited by an
evanescent wave that is produced when this occurs. This wave decays
exponentially, so that only fluorophores right at the surface are
excited – meaning fluorophores deeper within the specimen do not
interfere with the recording.

Importantly, because the subsequent recording is essentially similar to
that used when recording widefield images, photons are detected at all
pixels in parallel and fast recording-rates are possible. Therefore if
it is only necessary to see to a depth of about 100 nm, TIRF microscopy
may be a good choice.

[[sec-intro_detectors]]
Photon detectors
----------------

Certain detectors are associated with certain types of microscopy, and
differ according to the level and type of noise you can expect.
Understanding the basic principles greatly helps when choosing sensible
values for parameters such as gain, pixel size and binning during
acquisition to optimize the useful information in the image. The
following provides an very brief introduction to three common detectors.

[[pmts-one-pixel-at-a-time]]
PMTs: one pixel at a time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only need to record one pixel at a time, a _photomultiplier tube_
(PMT) might be what you need. The basic principle is this: a photon
strikes a photocathode, hopefully producing an electron. When this
occurs, the electron is accelerated towards a dynode, and any produced
electrons accelerated towards further dynodes. By adjusting the 'gain',
the acceleration of the electrons towards successive dynodes can be
varied; higher accelerations mean there is an increased likelihood that
the collision of the electrons with the dynode will produce a higher
number of electrons moving into the next stage. The charge of the
electrons is then quantified at the end (Figure <<fig-pmt>>), but because
the (possibly very small) number of original detected photons have now
been amplified to a (possibly much) larger number electrons by the
successive collisions with dynodes, the effect of read noise is usually
minor for a PMT.

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
Diagram showing the detection of a photon by a PMT. Each photon
can be 'multiplied' to produce many electrons by accelerating the first
produced electron towards a dynode, and repeating the process for all
electrons produced along a succession of dynodes. The charge of the
electrons reaching the end of the process can then be quantified, and
ought to be proportional to the number of photons that arrived at the
PMT.
--

More problematically, PMTs generally suffer from the problem of having
low _quantum efficiencies_ (QEs). The QE is a measure of the proportion
of photons striking the detector which then produce electrons, and
typical values for a conventional PMT may be only 10–15%: the majority
of the photons reaching the PMT are simply wasted. Thus photon noise can
be a major issue, especially if there is a low amount of light available
to detect in the first place.

.Converting electrons to pixels
[.info]
****
It is important to note that the final
pixel values are not _equal_ to numbers of detected photons – nor even
numbers of counted electrons. They are rather proportional, often with
an offset added. It is essential to estimate this offset (perhaps from a
background region or an image acquired without using any excitation
light) and subtract it if comparing pixel values in different images, as
well as to use identical acquisition settings.
****

[[sec-ccds]]
CCDs: fast imaging when there are a lot of photons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A _Charged Coupled Device_ (CCD) is a detector with a region devoted to
sensing photons, and which is subdivided into different 'physical
pixels' that correspond to pixels in the final image. Thus the image
size cannot be changed arbitrarily, but it is possible to record photons
for many pixels in parallel.

When a photon strikes a pixel in the sensing part of the CCD, this often
releases an electron – the QE is typically high (perhaps 90%). After a
certain exposure time, different 'electron clouds' have then formed at
each physical pixel on the sensor, each of which has a charge related to
the number of colliding photons. This charge is then measured by passing
the electrons through a charge amplifier, and the results used to assign
an intensity value to the pixel in the final image (Figure <<fig-ccd>>).

|===
**Figure {counter:figure}:**
An illustration of the basic operation of a CCD camera (using frame transfer). First, photons strike
a sense register, which is divided into pixels. This causes small clouds
of electrons to be released and gather behind the pixels (A). These are
then rapidly shifted downwards into another register of the same size,
thereby freeing the sense register to continue detecting photons (B). The
electron clouds are then shifted downwards again, one row at a time,
with each row finally being shifted sequentially through a charge
amplifier \(C). This quantifies the charge of the electron clouds, from
which pixel values for the final image are determined.
--

The electron clouds for each pixel might be larger than in the PMT case,
both because of the higher QE and because more time can be spent
detecting photons (since this is carried out for all pixels
simultaneously). However, the step of amplifying the numbers of
electrons safely above the read noise before quantification is missing.
Consequently, read noise is potentially more problematic, and in some
cases can even dominate the result.

[[sec-ccd_binning]]
Pixel binning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way to address the issue of CCD read noise is to use _pixel
binning_. In this case, the electrons from 4 (i.e.
2 × 2) pixels of the CCD are added together before
being quantified: the electron clouds are approximately 4 times bigger
relative to the read noise (Figure <<fig-ccd_binning>>), and readout can be
faster because fewer electron clouds need to be quantified. The obvious
disadvantage of this is that one cannot then put the electrons from the
4 pixels 'back where they belong'. As a result, the binned measurement
is simply treated as a single (bigger) pixel. The recorded image
contains 25% of the pixels in the unbinned image, while still covering
the same field of view, so spatial information is lost. Larger bins may
also be used, with a correspondingly more dramatic impact upon image
size (Figure <<fig-ccd_binning>>D).

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
Illustration of the effect of binning applied to an image suffering from photon and read
noise. As the bin size increases, the photons from neighboring pixels
are combined into a single (larger) pixel before the read noise is
added. As a consequence, the image becomes brighter relative to the read
noise – but at a cost of spatial information.
--

[[emccds-fast-imaging-with-low-light-levels]]
EMCCDs: fast imaging with low light levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And so you might wonder whether it is possible to increase the electron
clouds (like with the PMT) with an CCD, and so get its advantages
without the major inconvenience of read noise. _Electron Multiplying
CCDs_ (EMCCDs) achieve this to some extent. Here, the electrons are
first passed through an additional 'gain register' before
quantification. At every stage of this gain register, each electron has
a small probability – perhaps only 1% – of being amplified (through
'impact ionisation') and giving rise to two electrons entering the next
stage. Despite the small probability, by incorporating
> 500 such stages, the size of the electron cloud arising
from even a single photon may be amplified safely above the read noise.

However, the randomness of the amplification process itself introduces a
new source of uncertainty, so that the final outcome can be thought of
as having the same precision as if perhaps only around half as many
photons were detected (see <<../formation_noise/formation_noise.adoc#sec-photons_noise, Noise>> for the
relationship between noise and the number of photons). Therefore read
noise is effectively overcome at the cost of more photon noise.

A simplified diagram comparing a conventional CCD (with and
without binning) and an EMCCD. While each has the same physical number
of pixels, when binning is used electrons from several pixels are
combined before readout – thereby making the 'logical' pixels in the
final image bigger. For the EMCCD, the electrons are shifted through a
'gain register' prior to quantification. See Figure <<fig-ccd>> for
additional labels; the sense register has been omitted for simplicity.

.Question
[.question]
****
From a practical point of view, an EMCCD is rather like having
a CCD with no read noise, but with half the QE. Under what circumstances
(i.e. high or low numbers of photons) is an EMCCD preferable to a CCD?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
The gain register of EMCCDs offers benefits primarily when few
photons are available (i.e. when read-noise is the main problem, such as
in SDCM). CCDs are preferable when many photons are available (e.g. in
widefield).

If you are skeptical about this, consider an image in which your read
noise standard deviation is 10 electrons and you detect on average 9
electrons (originally photons). The photon noise then has a standard
deviation of 3. The read noise is much larger and will completely
dominate the image: nothing interesting will be visible. It is then
worth the cost of even more photon noise to be able to eliminate the
read noise. The final image will still look pretty bad, but at least
interpreting it is not hopeless.

But suppose you happen to have 90000 detected photons instead, in which
case the standard deviation of the photon noise is now 300. The read
noise of 10 is comparatively insignificant, and there is nothing to gain
from electron multiplication and making the photon noise situation
worse.
--
****

.Question
[.question]
****
Based upon the above descriptions, which detectors seem most
appropriate (generally!) for (a) widefield microscopy, (b) SDCM and (c)
LSCM?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
The following are reasonable rules of thumb:

* _Widefield microscopy:_ A CCD is suitable because of its ability to
record many pixels simultaneously. The large number of photons normally
detected means that read noise is not usually a big issue, and an EMCCD
can make the problem of noise worse instead of better.
* _Spinning Disk Confocal Microscopy:_ A CCD may be used, but an EMCCD
is often preferable. This is because SDCM usually gives lower photon
counts (certainly lower than in a comparable widefield image), which can
mean that read noise would dominate the result unless the photons are
somehow amplified.
* _Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy:_ PMTs are suitable, since the
image is built up one pixel at a time.
--
****

.Question
[.question]
****
<<sec-ccd_binning, Previously>>, we explored how CCDs can use
2 × 2 binning to combine the electrons corresponding
to multiple pixels together into a single pixel, which is then `less
noisy'. A similar effect can be achieved by just acquiring an image
without binning and applying a 2 × 2 filter, in which
all the coefficients have values of one. Both techniques result in
images that have roughly four times as many photons contributing to each
pixel, and thus a better SNR.

Think of one major advantage and one disadvantage of using filtering
_after_ acquisition, rather than binning _during_ acquisition.

.Answer
[.solution]
--
A 2 × 2 binned image contains 1/4 the
number of pixels of the original image. This represents a considerable
loss of spatial information, and you would get a different result if you
were to start binning at the first or second row or column, since
different pixels would be combined in each case. On the other hand,
filtering has the advantage of giving you an image that is exactly the
same size as the original. This is like getting all four possible binned
images for the price of one (i.e. all four different ways to split the
image into 2 × 2 pixel blocks, instead of just one
way), so less spatial information is lost. With filtering you also have
much more flexibility: you might choose a 3 × 3
filter instead, or a Gaussian filter, or a range of different filtering
options to see which is best. With binning, you need to choose one
option during acquisition and stick with it.

_However_, if _read noise_ is a major problem then filtering might not
be such a good choice. This is because read noise is added to every
acquired pixel once, and it does not matter if you have a few photons or
many – its standard deviation remains the same. Therefore, if the
electrons from four pixels are combined by binning during acquisition,
then only one 'unit' of read noise appears in the image corresponding to
those pixels. But an unbinned image would have read noise added four
times, and even after 2 × 2 filtering this is still
more read noise than in a comparable binned image. Sometimes this extra
noise is too high a cost for the flexibility of filtering, and binning
is better. (In this regard, remember that read noise is typically worse
for CCD cameras, but not such a problem for EMCCDs or PMTs.)
