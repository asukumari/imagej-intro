[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

A step used to process an image in some way is called an _operation_,
and the simplest examples are _point operations_. These act on
individual pixels, changing each in a way that depends upon its own
value, but not upon where it is or the values of other pixels. While not
immediately very glamorous, point operations often have indispensable
roles in more interesting contexts – and so it is essential to know
where to find them and how they are used.

[[sec-math_operations]]
Point operations using a single image
-------------------------------------

[[arithmetic]]
Arithmetic
~~~~~~~~~~

The menu:Process[Math] submenu is full of useful things to do with pixel
values. At the top of the list come the arithmetic operations: `Add...`,
`Subtract...`, `Multiply...` and `Divide...`. These might be used to
subtract background (extremely important when quantifying intensities;
see <<../macro_simulating/macro_simulating.adoc#chap, Simulating image formation>>) or scale the pixels of different
images into similar ranges (e.g. if the exposure time for one image was
twice that of the other, the pixel values should be divided by two to
make them more comparable) – and ought to mostly behave as you expect.

.Question
[.question]
****
Suppose you add a constant to every pixel in the image. Why
might subtracting the same constant from the result not give you back
the image you started with?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
If you add a constant that pushes pixel values outside the
range supported by the bit-depth (e.g. 0–255 for 8-bit), then the result
is clipped to the closest possible value. Subtracting the constant again
does not restore the original value. Note that this is less likely to
occur with a 32-bit image.
--

****

[[image-inversion]]
Image inversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inverting an image (menu:Edit[Invert]) effectively involves 'flipping' the
intensities: making the higher values lower, and the lower values
higher. In the case of 8-bit images, inverted pixel values can be easily
computed simply by subtracting the original values from the maximum
possible – i.e. from 255. Although this would work in principle for
16-bit images as well, it could have the slightly uncomfortable effect
of making an image containing only small values suddenly now only
contain huge ones.

.Why is inversion useful?
****
Suppose you have a good strategy designed to detect bright structures, but your images contain dark structures.
Simply invert your images first, then the structures become bright.
****

.Practical
[.practical]
****
menu:Edit[Invert] works differently when applied to different
image types. Like in the 8-bit case, pixel values are always subtracted
from some 'maximum' – your challenge is to work out how this maximum is
determined for 16 and 32-bit images in ImageJ.

(Note that the methods used for 16 and 32-bit images are not even the
same as one another.)

.Answer
[.solution]
--
At the time of writing, to invert a 16-bit image, pixel are
subtracted from _the maximum value within the original image_. This is
also true for stacks: the maximum value in the entire stack is found.

For 32-bit image inversion, the pixels are subtracted from the _display
maximum_, i.e. whatever maximum is set in the `Brightness/Contrast...`
dialog box. Consequently, inverting a 32-bit image can give different
results each time it is applied if the contrast settings are not kept
the same!

One way to improve predictability when inverting a 32-bit image is
simply to multiply each pixel by -1 instead of using the `Invert`
command – although this would not be a good strategy for 8 or 16-bit
images.

.Inverting LUTs
[.info]
****
Beware! You can also invert the colors used for display
with menu:Image[Lookup Tables > Invert LUT] – which _looks_ the same as if
the image is inverted, but does not change the pixel values
(Figure <<fig-image_inversion>>)!

Moreover, whether the LUT is inverted is saved inside TIFF files – and
so you could potentially open an image and find its LUT was inverted
before you even started to do anything, and thereby misjudge whether
structures are really brighter or darker than everything else. See
menu:File[Open Samples > Blobs] for an example of this.

[[sec-nonlinear_contrast]]
Nonlinear contrast enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With arithmetic operations we change the pixel values, usefully or
otherwise, but (assuming we have not fallen into the trap alluded to in
a previous question) we have done so in a _linear_ way. At most it would
take another multiplication and/or addition to get us back to where we
were. Because a similar relationship between pixel values exists, we
could also adjust the `Brightness/Contrast...` so that it does not
_look_ like we have done anything at all.

_Nonlinear_ point operations differ in that they affect relative values
differently depending upon what they were in the first place
(Figure <<fig-nonlinear_math>>). This turns out to be very useful for
displaying images with _high dynamic ranges_ – that is, a big difference
between the largest and smallest pixel values (e.g.
Figure <<fig-nonlinear_contrast>>). Using the `Brightness/Contrast...`
tool (which assigns LUT colors linearly to all the pixel values between
the minimum and maximum chosen) it might not be possible to find
settings that assign enough different colors to the brightest and
darkest regions simultaneously for all the interesting details to be
made visible.

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
Nonlinear transforms applied to a simple 'ramp' image, consisting of linearly increasing pixel values.
Replacing each pixel with its log or gamma-adjusted value has the effect of compressing either the lower or higher intensities closer together to free up more gray levels for the others.
--

The `Gamma...` or `Log...` commands within the menu:Process[Math] submenu
offer one type of solution. The former means that every pixel with a
value __p__ is replaced by __p^&gamma;^__, where
__&gamma;__ is some constant of your choosing. The latter
simply replaces pixel values with their natural logarithm. Examples of
these are shown in Figure <<fig-nonlinear_contrast>>. Some extra (linear)
rescaling is applied internally by ImageJ when using gamma and log
commands, since otherwise the resulting values might fall out of the
range supported by the bit-depth.

.Practical
[.practical]
****
Explore the use of the nonlinear transforms in the ImageJ
submenu menu:Process[Math] for enhancing the contrast of any image
(possibly `Spooked_16-bit.tif`). In particular, notice how the effects
change depending upon whether __&gamma;__ < 1 or not.
****

.Avoiding manipulation (important!)
[.info]
****
When creating figures for publication, changing the contrast
in some linear manner – i.e. just by scaling using the
`Brightness/Contrast...` tool – is normally considered fine (assuming
that it has not been done mischievously to make some inconvenient,
research-undermining details impossible to discern). _But if any
nonlinear operations are used, these should always be noted in the
figure legend!_ This is because, although nonlinear operations can be
very helpful when used with care, they can also easily mislead –
exaggerating or underplaying differences in brightness.
****

[[point-operations-involving-multiple-images]]
Point operations involving multiple images
------------------------------------------

Instead of applying arithmetic using an image and a constant, we could
also use two images of the same size. These can readily be added,
subtracted, multiplied or divided by applying the operations to the
corresponding pixels.

The command to do this is found under menu:Process[Image Calculator...]. But
beware of the bit-depth! If any of the original images are 8 or 16-bit,
then the result might require clipping or rounding, in which case
selecting the option to create a `32-bit (float) result` may be
necessary to get the expected output.

.The image calculator
****
Uses of the image calculator include:

* subtracting varying backgrounds
* comparing images
* computing intensity ratios
* masking out regions
** __and much more...__

.Question
[.question]
****
In the two 32-bit images shown here, white pixels have values of one and
black pixels have values of zero (gray pixels have values somewhere in
between).

|image::images/mask_orig.png[float=center]
|image::images/mask_bacteria.png[float=center]
|===

What would be the result of multiplying the images together? And what
would be the result of dividing the left image by the right image?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
Multiplying the images effectively results in everything
outside the white region in the right image being removed from the left
image (i.e. set to zero).

[cols="a", width=30%]
[frame=none, grid=none, halign=center]
|===
|image::images/mask_result.png[float=center]
|===


Dividing has a similar effect, except that instead of becoming zero the
masked-out pixels will take one of three results, depending upon the
original pixel's value in the left image:

* if it was _positive_, the result is $$+\infty$$
* if it was _negative_, the result is $$-\infty$$
* if it was zero, the result is `NaN` ('not a number' – indicating 0/0
is undefined)

These are special values that can be contained in floating point images,
but not images with integer types.

.Practical
[.practical]
****
With the help of the `Image Calculator`, confirm which two of
the images `Same_1.tif`, `Same_2.tif` and `Same_3.tif` are identical in
terms of pixel values, and which is different.

.Answer
[.solution]
--
My preferred way to check this is to subtract the images from
one another, making sure that the result is 32-bit (in case there are
negative values). Doing this should reveal something hidden in the image
`Same_2.tif`. Note that the contrast settings differ between
`Same_1.tif` and `Same_3.tif`, so they may _look_ different.

(Note that the calculator's `Difference` or `Divide` commands could also
be used. `XOR` would work as well, but its output is harder to interpret
since it involves comparing individual bits used to store each pixel
value and gives an output where all matching bits are 0 and all
non-matching bits are 1. When converted back into actual decimal values
and then to colors for us to look at, this can appear strange. But at
least if the resulting image is not completely black then we know that
the original input images were not identical.)

.Modelling image formation: Adding noise
[.info]
****
Fluorescence images are invariably noisy. The noise appears as a graininess
throughout the image, which can be seen as arising from a random noise
value (positive or negative) being added to every pixel. This is
equivalent to adding a separate 'noise image' to the non-existent
cleaner image that we would prefer to have recorded. If we knew the
pixels in the noise image then we could simply subtract it to get the
clean result – but, in practice, their randomness means that we do not.

[cols="a", width=60%]
[frame=none, grid=none, halign=center]
|===
|image::images/adding_noise.png[float=center]
|===

Nevertheless, even the idea of a noise image being added is extremely
useful. We can use it to create simulations in which the noise behaves
statistically just like real noise, and add it to clean images. Using
these simulations we can figure out things like how processing steps or
changes during acquisition will affect or reduce the noise, or how
sensitive our measurement strategies are to changes in image quality
(see <<../filters/filters.adoc#chap, Filters>>, <<../formation_noise/formation_noise.adoc#chap, Noise>> and
<<../macro_simulating/macro_simulating.adoc#chap, Simulating image formation>>).
