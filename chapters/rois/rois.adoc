Measuring images
----------------

The main command for measuring in ImageJ is found under
menu:Analyze[Measure] (or just press kbd:[M]), where
menu:Analyze[Set Measurements...] determines what measurements are
actually made. Possibilities include areas, perimeters, lengths, and
minimum, maximum and mean pixel intensities (here referred to as 'gray
values'), as well as further measurements of shapes or intensities
(Figure <<fig-measure>>B). By default, measurements are made over the
entire area of the currently-selected 2D image slice, and added to a
_results table_ (Figure <<fig-measure>>C).

.Important!
[.standout]
****
Size measurements are automatically scaled according to the pixel sizes
in menu:Image[Image > Properties...], so these must be correct!

.Results tables & their titles
[.info]
****
A small idiosyncrasy to be aware of is that, as far as ImageJ is
concerned, there is only ever one 'official' results table – the one
with the title `Results`. Different, similar-looking tables can be
produced (perhaps by duplicating the official table, or internally by
some other command), but any new measurements you make with the
`Measure` command will _only_ be added to the official table. The
official table also has an extra `Results` entry in its menu bar.

.Caution with measurements
[.info]
****
`Set Measurements...` deserves your close
attention! Because all new measurements are added to the same results
table, when working with multiple images it can be hard to remember
which measurement refers to which image. It is therefore a very good
idea to choose `Display label` under `Set Measurements...`, to ensure
the image title is included in the table. When working with higher
dimensions, choosing `Stack Position` lets you know which 2D slice of
the entire dataset has been measured.

Also, for now, make sure that `Redirect to` is set to `None`. This is
_normally_ what you want, to avoid merrily measuring the wrong image by
accident (see <<../thresholding/thresholding.adoc#chap, Detection by thresholding>>).
****

[[regions-of-interest]]
Regions Of Interest
-------------------

Usually we want to measure something _within_ an image and not the whole
thing. Regions Of Interest (ROIs) can be used to define specific parts
of an image that should be processed independently or measured, and so
only pixels within any ROI we draw will be included in the calculations
when we run `Measure`.

ROI drawing tools are found on the left side of the ImageJ tool bar (A).
The ROI in (B) was created by drawing one rectangular and two circular ROIs, holding down the kbd:[Shift] key between each so that the regions were combined.
--

ROIs of different types (e.g. rectangles, circles, lines, points,
polygons, freehand shapes) can be drawn using the commands in the tool
bar (Figure <<fig-roi_drawing>>), and are invariably 2D. Right-clicking
the tools often provides access to related tools, while double-clicking
may give additional options. When drawing a ROI, pressing kbd:[Shift] or
kbd:[Control] before releasing the mouse button adds the ROI being drawn to
any existing ROI already present.

Some extra commands to create or adjust ROIs appear under the
menu:Edit[Selection] submenu, which we will make more use of later.

.Measurement accuracy
[.info]
****
Although ImageJ can measure very exactly whatever
regions it is told to measure _within an image_, keep in mind that in
light microscopy images any size measurements will not exactly
correspond to sizes of structures _in real life_. This is especially
true at very small scales (hundreds of nanometers or smaller), for
blur-related reasons that will be described in
<<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#chap, Blur & the PSF>>.
****

[[working-with-multiple-regions]]
Working with multiple regions
-----------------------------

Normally, only a single ROI can be 'active' (i.e. affecting
measurements) at any one time. If you need control over multiple ROIs,
there are two places in which you can store them, differing according to
purpose:

1.  _The ROI Manager:_ for most ROIs that you want to be able to edit
and use for measurements
2.  _The image overlay:_ for ROIs that you only want to display

[[the-roi-manager]]
The ROI Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _ROI Manager_ provides a convenient way to store multiple ROIs in a
list, allowing you to easily access, edit and measure them. The slow way
to open it is to choose menu:Analyze[Tools > ROI Manager...]. The fast way
is just to draw a ROI and press kbd:[T]footnote:[Easily memorable as
'__T__ake this ROI and add it to the ROI Manager'. Or '__T__roy
Manager'.]. The additional `Measure` command within the manager is then
like applying menu:Analyze[Measure] to each ROI in turn. If you happen to
want to show all the ROIs simultaneously, you can select the `Show All`
optionfootnote:[If you have a stack, you also may need to explore
`More >> Options...` to define whether all ROIs are shown on all slices,
or only on the slices on which they were first created.].

Because ROIs in the ROI Manager are represented independently of the
image on which they were defined, you can create a ROI on one image, add
it to the ROI manager, select a different image and then click on the
ROI in the ROI Manager to place it on the second image. Measurements
made from the ROI Manager always use the most recently-selected image,
so be careful if you have several images open at the same time.

.Transferring ROIs
****
A faster way to transfer ROIs between images without using the ROI Manager is to click on the second image and press kbd:[Shift + E] (the shortcut for menu:Edit[Selection > Restore Selection])
****

.Expert ROI manipulation with the ROI Manager
[.info]
****
Using the ROI Manager, you
can craft your ROIs into more complex shapes, adding or removing other
ROIs.

To do this, first add the main ROIs you want to work with to the manager.
Then select them, and choose from among the options:

* `AND` – create a ROI containing only the regions where the selected
ROIs overlap
* `OR` – create a single ROI composed by combining all the selected ROIs
* `XOR` – create a single ROI containing all the selected ROIs, _except_
the places where they overlap ('eXclusive OR')
****

[[overlays]]
Overlays
~~~~~~~~

Overlays also contain a list of ROIs that are shown simultaneously on
the image, but which do _not_ affect the `Measure` command. They are
therefore suitable for storing annotations for visualization purposes. You can think of them as
existing on their own separate layer, so that adding and removing the
overlay does not mess up the underlying pixel values
(Figure <<fig-rois>>). The relevant commands are found in the
menu:Image[Overlay] submenu, where you can get started by drawing a ROI
and choosing `Add Selection` (or simply press kbd:[B]footnote:[For
'__B__overlay'.]). The same submenu also provides commands to transfer
ROIs between the overlay and the ROI Manager.

.Adjusting overlays
****
You can 'reactivate' a ROI on an overlay by clicking it with the kbd:[Alt] key pressed (provided a suitable ROI tool is selected).
****


[[saving-rois]]
Saving ROIs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Individual ROIs can be saved simply by choosing
menu:File[Save As > Selection...] The ROI Manager itself has a `Save...`
command (under `More`), which will save whichever ROIs are currently
selected (or, if none are selected, all of them). Overlays are fixed to
specific images and do not have their own special save command, but will
nonetheless be included if you save the image as a TIFF file (ImageJ's
default format). Any currently-active ROI will also be saved in a TIFF.

This is fine if you work only in ImageJ or Fiji, but unfortunately if
you try to view your ROIs in other software it is highly unlikely to
work properly, since the format is specific to ImageJ. The way around
this is to use the menu:Image[Overlay > Flatten] command. This creates an
_RGB copy of the image in which the pixel values have been changed_ so
that any ROIs or overlays will appear whenever you open the image
elsewhere. Therefore you may well want to use this command when creating
figures or presentations, but you do _not_ want to subsequently apply
your analysis to the image you have flattened – always use the original
instead.

For more details on the impact of converting an image to RGB, see <<../colors/colors.adoc#chap, Channels & colors>>.

Flattened images may appear the same on screen, but are invariably RGB (see <<../colors/colors.adoc#chap, Channels & colors>>) and have had their pixel values permanently changed to show any annotations.

image:images/annotated_cyclists.png[width=240,float="right"]
Open the images `Annotated_Cyclists_1.tif` and
`Annotated_Cyclists_2.tif`, which depict the 3 main cyclist
characteristics I found most disconcerting as a pedestrian in
Heidelberg.

The images should initially look the same, but in one the text is an
overlay, while in the other the image has been flattened. Which is
which? Try to think of several ways to investigate this.

.Answer
[.solution]
--
`Annotated_Cyclists_1.tif` is the one with the overlay.

Five ways to determine whether an annotation is an overlay or not:

1.  Zoom in very closely to the region containing the annotation. If it
becomes 'blocky', i.e. made up of pixels, it is not an overlay. If it
remains smooth, then it is.
2.  Move your cursor over the region where the annotation appears, and
look at the pixel values. If the values are all the same where the
annotation is present, but different elsewhere, then it is unlikely to
be an overlay.
3.  Using the paintbrush or pencil tool from the toolbar, try putting
some other color where the annotation appears. If the annotation remains
visible on top of where you drew, it must be on an overlay.
4.  Choose menu:Image[Overlay > Hide Overlay] and see if the annotation
disappears.
5.  Choose menu:Image[Overlay > To ROI Manager] and see if anything
happens at all.

.Practical
[.practical]
****
Using the cyclist image containing the overlay from the
previous practical, rearrange the annotations so that they are each
positioned next to different cyclists. You could do this by deleting the
overlay and starting again, but there are other, faster possibilities
(using a technique mentioned before, or the
menu:Image[Overlay > To ROI Manager] command).

.Answer
[.solution]
--
_Old solution (when I wrote this question):_ Once the ROIs are
in the ROI Manager, you can click on each and then move it. However, the
original ROI will still stay in the manager – so after moving, you need
to add the newly-positioned ROI to the manager, and delete the old one
again.

_Solution since ImageJ v1.46m:_ Click the annotation while holding down
the kbd:[Alt] key, to bring it to life so it can be moved around again. This
only works if certain tools are selected, e.g. `Rectangle` or `Text`,
because some other tools have more overriding functions, such as zooming
in or scrolling.
