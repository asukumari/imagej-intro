Introduction
------------

We could reasonably expect that a noise-free microscopy image should
look pleasantly smooth, not least because the convolution with the PSF
has a blurring effect that softens any sharp transitions. Yet in
practice raw fluorescence microscopy images are not smooth. They are
always, to a greater or lesser extent, corrupted by noise. This appears
as a random 'graininess' throughout the image, which is often so strong
as to obscure details.

This chapter considers the nature of the noisiness, where it comes from,
and what can be done about it. Before starting, it may be helpful to
know the one major lesson of this chapter for the working microscopist
is simply:

[.standout]
****
If you want to reduce noise, you need to detect more photons
****

This general guidance applies in the overwhelming majority of cases when
a good quality microscope is functioning properly. Nevertheless, it may
be helpful to know a bit more detail about why – and what you might do
if detecting more photons is not feasible.

--

In general, we can assume that noise in fluorescence microscopy images
has the following three characteristics, illustrated in
Figure <<fig-noise_demo>>:

1.  _Noise is random_ – For any pixel, the noise is a random positive or
negative number added to the 'true value' the pixel should have.
2.  _Noise is independent at each pixel_ – The value of the noise at any
pixel does not depend upon where the pixel is, or what the noise is at
any other pixel.
3.  _Noise follows a particular distribution_ – Each noise value can be
seen as a _random variable_ drawn from a particular distribution. If we
have enough noise values, their histogram would resemble a plot of the
distributionfootnote:[Specifically its probability density or mass
function – which for a Gaussian distribution is the familiar bell
curve.].

There are many different possible noise distributions, but we only need
to consider the _Poisson_ and _Gaussian_ cases. No matter which of these
we have, the most interesting distribution parameter for us is the
_standard deviation_. Assuming everything else stays the same, if the
standard deviation of the noise is higher then the image looks worse
(Figure <<fig-gaussian_hists>>).

The reason we will consider two distributions is that there are two main
types of noise for us to worry about:

1.  _Photon noise_, from the emission (and detection) of the light
itself. This follows a Poisson distribution, for which _the standard
deviation changes with the local image brightness_.
2.  _Read noise_, arising from inaccuracies in quantifying numbers of
detected photons. This follows a Gaussian distribution, for which _the
standard deviation stays the same throughout the image_.

Therefore the noise in the image is really the result of adding
twofootnote:[Actually more. But the two mentioned here are usually by
far the most significant, and it does not matter to our model at all if
they contain various other sub-components. The important fact remains
that there is some noise that varies throughout the image, and some that
does not.] separate random components together. In other words, to get
the value of any pixel $$P$$ you need to calculate the sum of
the 'true' (noise-free) value $$T$$, a random photon noise
value $$N_p$$, and a random read noise value
$$N_r$$, i.e.

$$
P = T + N_p + N_r
$$

Finally, some useful maths: suppose we add two random noisy values
together. Both are independent and drawn from distributions (Gaussian or
Poisson) with standard deviations $$\sigma_1$$ and
$$\sigma_2$$. The result is a third random value, drawn from a
distribution with a standard deviation
$$\sqrt{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}$$. On the other hand, if we
multiply a noisy value from a distribution with a standard deviation
$$\sigma_1$$ by $$k$$, the result is noise from a
distribution with a standard deviation $$k\sigma_1$$.

These are all my most important noise facts, upon which the rest of this
chapter is built. We will begin with Gaussian noise because it is easier
to work with, found in many applications, and widely studied in the
image processing literature. However, in _most_ fluorescence images
photon noise is the more important factor.

[[gaussian-noise]]
Gaussian noise
--------------

Gaussian noise is a common problem in fluorescence images acquired using
a CCD camera (see <<../microscope_types/microscope_types.adoc#chap, Microscopes & detectors>>). It arises at the
stage of quantifying the number of photons detected for each pixel.
Quantifying photons is hard to do with complete precision, and the
result is likely to be wrong by at least a few photons. This error is the read
noise.

Read noise typically follows a Gaussian distribution and has a mean of
zero: this implies there is an equal likelihood of over or
underestimating the number of photons. Furthermore, according to the
properties of Gaussian distributions, we should expect around
~68% of measurements to be ±1 standard
deviation from the true, read-noise-free value. If a detector has a low
read noise standard deviation, this is then a good thing: it means the error should be small.

[[signal-to-noise-ratio-snr]]
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read noise is said to be _signal independent_: its standard deviation is
constant, and does not depend upon how many photons are being
quantified. However, the extent to which read noise is a problem
probably _does_ depend upon the number of photons. For example, if we
have detected 20 photons, a noise standard deviation of 10 photons is
huge; if we have detected 10 000 photons, it is likely not so important.

A better way to assess the noisiness of an image is then the ratio of
the interesting part of each pixel (called the _signal_, which is here
what we would ideally detect in terms of photons) to the noise standard
deviation, which together is known as the __Signal-to-Noise
Ratio__footnote:[This is one definition of SNR. Many other definitions
appear in the literature, leading to different values. The fact that any
interesting image will vary in brightness in different places means that the SNR
is not necessarily the same at all pixels – therefore computing it in
practice involves coming up with some summary measurement for the whole
image. This can be approached differently, but the general principle is
always to compare how much noise we have relative to interesting things:
where higher is better.]:

[[eqn-snr]]
$$
\textrm{SNR} = \frac{\textrm{Signal}}{\textrm{Noise standard deviation}}
$$

.Question
[.question]
****
Calculate the SNR in the following cases:

* We detect an average of 10 photons, read noise standard deviation 1 photon
* We detect an average of 100 photons, read noise standard deviation 10 photons
* We detect an average of 1000 photons, read noise standard deviation 10 photons

For the purposes of this question, you should assume that read noise is
the only noise present (ignore photon noise).

.Answer
[.solution]
--
* We detect an average of 10 photons, read noise std. dev. 1 photon: _SNR = 10_
* We detect an average of 100 photons, read noise std. dev. 10 photons: _SNR = 10_
* We detect an average of 1000 photons, read noise std. dev. 10 photons: _SNR = 100_

The noise causes us a similar degree of uncertainty in the first two
cases. In the third case, the noise is likely to be less problematic:
higher SNRs are good.

[[gaussian-noise-simulations]]
Gaussian noise simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I find the best way to learn about noise is by creating simulation
images, and exploring their properties through making and testing
predictions. menu:Process[Noise > Add Specified Noise...] will add
Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of your choosing to any image.
If you apply this to an empty 32-bit image created using
menu:File[New > Image...] you can see noise on its own.

Create an image containing only simulated Gaussian noise with
a standard deviation of approximately 3. Confirm using its histogram or
the `Measure` command that this standard deviation is correct.

Now add to this _more_ Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 4.
Keeping in mind the end of <<sec-noise_background, the background section>>, what do you
expect the standard deviation of the result to be?

`gauss_noise_1.tif` and `gauss_noise_2.tif` are two images
containing Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 5. Estimate (and
optionally test with `Image Calculator...` and `Measure`), what the
standard deviations will be:

1.  When you add both images together
2.  When you subtract `gauss_noise_2.tif` from `gauss_noise_1.tif`
3.  When you subtract `gauss_noise_1.tif` from `gauss_noise_2.tif`
4.  When you average both images together
5.  When you add an image to itself

.Answer
[.solution]
--
When operating on the noise images with standard deviations of
5, the (approximate) standard deviations you should get are:

1.  $$\sqrt{50} = 7.1$$ – add the variances, then take the
square root
2.  $$\sqrt{50} = 7.1$$ – same as addition; switching the sign
(positive or negative) of a Gaussian noise image with zero mean just
gives another Gaussian noise image with zero mean
3.  $$\sqrt{50} = 7.1$$ – the order of subtraction doesn't
matter
4.  $$\sqrt{50}/2 = 3.5$$ – same as addition, but divide the
result by 2
5.  $$10$$ – equivalent to multiplying the image by 2, so
multiply the standard deviation by 2

[[averaging-noise]]
Averaging noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<<sec-noise_background, At the beginning of this chapter it was>> stated how to calculate the new standard
deviation if noisy pixels are added together (i.e. it is the square root
of the sum of the original variances). If the original standard
deviations are the same, the result is always something _higher_. But if
the pixels are _averaged_, then the resulting noise standard deviation
is _lower_.

This implies that if we were to average two independent
noisy images of the same scene with similar SNRs, we would get a result
that contains _less_ noise, i.e. a higher SNR. This is the idea
underlying our use of linear filters to reduce noise in
<<../filters/filters.adoc#chap, Filters>>, except that rather than using two images we
computed our averages by taking other pixels from within the same image
(Figures <<fig-gaussian_hists_mean>>).

Create another image containing simulated Gaussian noise with
a standard deviation of 30. What do you expect the standard deviation to
be after applying a 3 × 3 mean filter (e.g.
menu:Process[Smooth])? The calculation you need is much the same as in the
last practical, but with some extra scaling involved.

Now apply the filter to the same image a second time. Is the noise
reduced by a similar amount? How do you explain your answer?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
After applying the filter once, the standard deviation should
be around 10. Using a 3 × 3 mean filter, the noise
standard deviation should be reduced to around 1/3 of its
original value.

You can break down the problem this way:

* Let the original noise standard deviation be $$\sigma$$, the
variance is $$\sigma^2$$
* The filter first replaces each pixel with the sum of 9 independent
values. The variance becomes $$9\sigma^2$$, the standard
deviation $$\sqrt{9\sigma^2} = 3\sigma$$
* The filter divides the result by 9 to give means. This also divides
the standard deviation by 9, giving $$3\sigma/9 = \sigma/3$$

However, when I apply the filter a second time, the standard deviation
is 7. It has decreased by much less, despite using the same filter. This
is because _after the first filtering, the noise is no longer
independent at each pixel_.

[[sec-photons_noise]]
Poisson noise
-------------

In 1898, Ladislaus Bortkiewicz published a book entitled _The Law of
Small Numbers_. Among other things, it included a now-famous analysis of
the number of soldiers in different corps of the Prussian cavalry who
were killed by being kicked by a horse, measured over a 20-year period.
Specifically, he showed that these numbers follows a _Poisson
distribution_.

This distribution, introduced by Siméon Denis Poisson in
1838, gives the probability of an event happening a certain number of
times, given that we know (1) the average rate at which it occurs, and
(2) that all of its occurrences are independent. However, the usefulness
of the Poisson distribution extends far beyond gruesome military
analysis to many, quite different applications – including the
probability of photon emission, which is itself inherently random.

(B) The 'Probability Mass Function' of the Poisson distribution for several different values of λ.
This allows one to see for any 'true signal' λ the probability of actually counting any actual value k.
Although it is more likely that one will count exactly k = λ than any other possible k, as λ increases the probability of getting precisely this value becomes smaller and smaller.
--

Suppose that, on average, a single photon will be emitted from some part
of a fluorescing sample within a particular time interval. The
randomness entails that we cannot say for sure what will happen on any
one occasion when we look; sometimes one photon will be emitted,
sometimes none, sometimes two, occasionally even more. What we are
really interested in, therefore, is not precisely _how many_ photons are
emitted, which varies, but rather the _rate_ at which they would be
emitted under fixed conditions, which is a constant. The difference
between the number of photons actually emitted and the true rate of
emission is the _photon noise_. The trouble is that keeping the
conditions fixed might not be possible: leaving us with the problem of
trying to figure out rates from single, noisy measurements.

[[signal-dependent-noise]]
Signal-dependent noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clearly, since it is a rate that we want, we could get that with more
accuracy if we averaged many observations – just like with Gaussian
noise, averaging reduces photon noise.  Therefore, we can expect smoothing
filters to work similarly for both noise types - and they do.

The primary distinction between the noise types, however, is that
Poisson noise is _signal-dependent_, and _does_ change according to the
number of emitted (or detected) photons. Fortunately, the relationship
is simple: if the rate of photon emission is $$\lambda$$, the
noise variance is also $$\lambda$$, and the noise standard
deviation is $$\sqrt{\lambda}$$.

This is not really as unexpected as it might first seem (see
Figure <<fig-fishing>>). It can even be observed from a very close
inspection of Figure <<fig-noise_yeast>>, in which the increased
variability in the yeast cells causes their ghostly appearance even in
an image that ought to consist only of noise.

To understand this better, it may help to imagine a fisherman, fishing many times at the same location and under the same conditions.
If he catches 10 fish on average, it would be quite reasonable to catch 7 or 13 on any one day – while 20 would be exceptional.
If, however, he caught 100 on average, then it would be unexceptional if he caught 90 or 110 on a particular day, although catching only 10 would be strange (and presumably disappointing).
Intuitively, the range of values that would be considered likely is related to the expected value.
If nothing else, this imperfect analogy may at least help remember the name of the distribution that photon noise follows.

.Question
[.question]
****
The formula for the probability mass function of the Poisson
distribution is:

[[eqn-poisson]]
$$
\mathcal{P}(\lambda) \sim \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k}}{k!}
$$

where

* $$\lambda$$ is the mean rate of occurrence of the event
(i.e. the noise-free photon emission rate we want)
* $$k$$ is an actual number of occurrences for which we want
to compute the probability
* $$k!$$ is the _factorial_ of $$k$$ (i.e.
$$k \times (k-1) \times (k-2) \times ... \times 1$$)

So if you know that the rate of photon emission is 0.5, for example, you
can put $$\lambda = 0.5$$ into the equation and determine the
probability of getting any particular (integer) value of $$k$$
photons. Applying this, the probability of not detecting any photons
($$k = 0$$) is 0.6065, while the probability of detecting a
single photon ($$k = 1$$) is $$0.3033$$.

Assuming the mean rate of photon emission is 1, use
<<eqn-poisson, the formula for the Poisson distribution probability mass function>>
to calculate the probability of actually detecting 5 (which, at 5 times the true rate, would be an extremely
inaccurate result). How common do you suppose it is to find pixels that
are so noisy in the background region of a dark image?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
The probability of detecting 5 photons is approximately
0.0031.

$$
\frac{e^{-1}}{5!} = \frac{1}{120e} = 0.0031
$$

Although this is a very low probability, images contain so many pixels
that one should expect to see such noisy values often. For example, in a
rather dark and dull 512 × 512 pixel image in which
the average photon emission rate is 1, we would expect 800 pixels to
have a value of 5 – and two pixels even to have a value of 8. The
presence of isolated bright or dark pixels therefore usually tells us
very little indeed, and it is only by processing the image more
carefully and looking at surrounding values that we can (sometimes)
discount the possibility these are simply the result of noise.

****

[[the-snr-for-poisson-noise]]
The SNR for Poisson noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the standard deviation of noise was the only thing that mattered,
this would suggest that we are better not detecting much light: then
photon noise is lower. But the SNR is a much more reliable guide. For
noise that follows a Poisson distribution this is particularly easy to
calculate. Substituting into <<eqn-snr, the formula for the SNR>>

[[eqn-snr_poisson]]
$$
\textrm{SNR}_{Poiss} = \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda}} = \sqrt{\lambda}
$$

Therefore _the SNR of photon noise is equal
to the square root of the signal_! This means that as the average number
of emitted (and thus detected) photons increases, so too does the SNR.
More photons &rarr; a better SNR, directly leading to
the assertion

If you want to reduce photon noise, you need to detect more photons

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
For Poisson noise, the standard deviation increases with the square root of the signal.
So does the SNR, with the result that plots (A) and (B) look identical.
This improvement in SNR despite the growing noise occurs because the signal is increasing faster than the noise, and so the noise is relatively smaller.
Plotting the relative noise (1/SNR) shows this effect \(C).
--

.Why relativity matters: a simple example
[.info]
****
The SNR increases with the
number of photons, even though the noise standard deviation increases
too, because it is really _relative_ differences in the brightness in
parts of the image that we are interested in. Absolute numbers usually
are of very little importance – which is fortunate, since not all
photons are detected.

Yet if you remain unconvinced that the noise variability can get bigger
while the situation gets better, the following specific example might
help. Suppose the true signal for a pixel is 4 photons. Assuming the
actual measured value is within one noise standard deviation of the
proper result (which it will be, about 68% of the time), one expects it
to be in the range 2–6. The true signal at another pixel is twice as
strong – 8 photons – and, by the same argument, one expects to measure a
value in the range 5–11. _The ranges for both pixels overlap!_ With
photon counts this low, even if the signal doubles in brightness, we
often cannot discern with confidence that the two pixels are even
different at all. In fact, it is quite possible that the second pixel
gives a _lower_ measurement than the first.

On the other hand, suppose the true signal for the first pixel is 100
photons, so we measure something in the range of 90–110. The second
pixel, still twice as bright, gives a measurement in the range 186–214.
These ranges are larger, but crucially they are not even close to
overlapping, so it is very easy to tell the pixels apart. Thus the noise
standard deviation alone is not a very good measure of how noisy an
image is. The SNR is much more informative: the simple rule is that
higher is better. Or, if that still does not feel right, you can turn it
upside down and consider the noise-to-signal ratio (the _relative
noise_), in which case lower is better (Figure <<fig-snr_plot>>).
****

[[poisson-noise-detection]]
Poisson noise & detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So why should you care that photon noise is signal-dependent?

One reason is that it can make features of identical sizes and
brightnesses easier or harder to detect in an image purely because of
the local background. This is illustrated in Figure <<fig-poisson_ramp>>.

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
The signal-dependence of Poisson noise affects how visible (and therefore detectable) structures are in an image.
(A) Six spots of the same absolute brightness are added to an image with a linearly increasing background _(top)_ and Poisson noise is added _(bottom)_.
Because the noise variability becomes higher as the background increases, only the spots in the darkest part of the image can be clearly seen in the profile.
(B) Spots of the same brightness relative to the background are added, along with Poisson noise.
Because the noise is relatively lower as the brightness increases, now only the spots in the brightest part of the image can be seen.

In general, if we want to see a fluorescence increase of a fixed number
of photons, this is easier to do if the background is very dark. But if
the fluorescence increase is defined _relative_ to the background, it
will be much easier to identify if the background is high. Either way,
when attempting to determine the number of any small structures in an
image, for example, we need to remember that the numbers we will be able
to detect will be affected by the background nearby. Therefore results
obtained from bright and dark regions might not be directly comparable.

.Simulating photon noise
[.info]
****
If you install the https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/randomj/[RandomJ] set of
pluginsfootnote:[See https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/randomj/], you can add simulated Poisson noise to an image using
menu:Process[Noise > RandomJ > RandomJ Poisson]. The pixel values before
adding the noise will be treated as the true signal if you select
`Insertion: modularity`, in which case the choice of `Mean` setting does
not matter.

Open the images `mystery_noise_1.tif` and
`mystery_noise_2.tif`. Both are noisy, but in one the noise follows a
Gaussian distribution (like read noise) and in the other it follows a
Poisson distribution (like photon noise). Which is which?

.Answer
[.solution]

The noise in `mystery_noise_1.tif` is Gaussian, it is Poisson
in `mystery_noise_2.tif`. Since there are reasonably flat regions within
the cell and background, I would test this by drawing a ROI within each
and measuring the standard deviations. Where these are similar, the
noise is Gaussian; if there is a big difference, the noise is likely to
be Poisson.

If no flat regions were available, I would try applying a gradient
filter with the coefficients `-1 1 0`, and inspecting the results.
Alternatively, I might try plotting a fluorescence profile or
subtracting a very slightly smoothed version of each image.

Combining noise sources
-----------------------

Combining our noise sources then, we can imagine an actual pixel value
as being the sum of three values: the true rate of photon emission, the
photon noise component, and the read noise componentfootnote:[For a
fuller picture, gain and offset also need to be taken into
consideration, see <<../microscope_types/microscope_types.adoc#chap, Microscopes & detectors>>.]. The first of these
is what we want, while the latter two are random numbers that may be
positive or negative.

**Figure {counter:figure}:**
An illustration of how photon noise differs from read noise.
When both are added to a signal (here, a series of steps in which the value doubles at each higher step), the relative importance of each depends upon the value of the signal.
At low signal levels this doubling is very difficult to discern amidst either type of noise, and even more so when both noise components are present.
--

This is illustrated in Figure <<fig-noise_steps>> using a simple 1D signal
consisting of a series of steps. Random values are added to this to
simulate photon and read noise. Whenever the signal is very low
(indicating few photons), the variability in the photon noise is very
low (but high _relative_ to the signal! (B)). This variability increases
when the signal increases. However, in the read noise case \(C), the
variability is similar everywhere. When both noise types are combined in
(D), the read noise dominates completely when there are few photons, but
has very little impact whenever the signal increases. Photon noise has
already made detecting relative differences in brightness difficult when
there are few photons; with read noise, it can become hopeless.

Therefore overcoming read noise is critical for low-light imaging, and
the choice of detector is extremely important (see
<<../microscope_types/microscope_types.adoc#chap, Microscopes & detectors>>). But, where possible, detecting more
photons is an _extremely_ good thing anyway, since it helps to overcome
_both_ types of noise.

.Other noise sources
[.info]
****
Photon and read noise are the main sources of noise
that need to be considered when designing and carrying out an
experiment. One other source often mentioned in the literature is _dark
noise_, which can be thought of as arising when a wayward electron causes the detector to
register a photon even when there was not actually one there. In very
low-light images, this lead to spurious bright pixels. However, dark
noise is less likely to cause problems if many true photons are
detected, and many detectors reduce its occurrence by cooling the
sensor.

If the equipment is functioning properly, other noise sources could
probably not be distinguished from these three. Nevertheless, brave
souls who wish to know more may find a concise, highly informative, list
of more than 40 sources of imprecision in _The 39 steps: a cautionary
tale of quantitative 3-D fluorescence microscopy_ by James Pawley (available online from various sources).

.Question
[.question]
****
Suppose you have an image that does not contain much light, but has some
isolated bright pixels. Which ImageJ command could you use to remove
them? And is it safe to assume they are due to dark noise or something
similar, or might the pixels correspond to actual bright structures?

.Answer
[.solution]
--
A median filter is a popular choice for removing isolated
bright pixels, although I sometimes prefer
menu:Process[Noise > Remove Outliers...] because this only puts the
median-filtered output in the image if the original value was really
extreme (according to some user-defined threshold). This then preserves
the independence of the noise at all other pixels – so it still behaves
reliably and predictably like Poisson + Gaussian noise. We can reduce
the remaining noise with a Gaussian filter if necessary.

Assuming that the size of a pixel is smaller than the PSF (which is
usually the case in microscopy), it is a good idea to remove these
outliers. They _cannot_ be real structures, because any real structure
would have to extend over a region at least as large as the PSF. However
if the pixel size is very large, then we may not be able to rule out
that the 'outliers' are caused by some real, bright structures.

[[sec-nyquist]]
Finding photons
---------------

There are various places from which the extra photons required to
overcome noise might come. One is to simply acquire images more slowly,
spending more time detecting light. If this is too harsh on the sample,
it may be possible to record multiple images quickly. If there is little
movement between exposures, these images could be added or averaged to
get a similar effect (Figure <<fig-noise_averaging>>).

An alternative would be to increase the pixel size, so that each pixel incorporates
photons from larger regions – although clearly this comes at a
<<../microscope_types/microscope_types.adoc#sec-ccd_binning, cost in spatial information>>.

.Nyquist sampling
[.info]
****
Small pixels are needed to see detail, but also reduce
the number of photons per pixel and thereby increase noise. However,
<<../formation_spatial/formation_spatial.adoc#chap, Blur & the PSF>> has already argued that ultimately it
is not pixel size, but rather the PSF that limits spatial resolution –
which suggests that there is a minimum pixel size below which nothing is
gained, and the only result is that more noise is added.

This size can be determined based upon knowledge of the PSF and the
_Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem_ (Figure <<fig-nyquist_shannon>>).
Images acquired with this pixel size are said to be _Nyquist sampled_.
The easiest way to determine the corresponding pixel size for a given
experiment is to use the online calculator provided by Scientific Volume
Imaging at http://www.svi.nl/NyquistCalculator. You may need larger
pixels to reduce noise or see a wider field of view, but you do not get
anything extra by using smaller pixels.
